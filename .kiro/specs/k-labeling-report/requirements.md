# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves generating a comprehensive, formal academic report comparing two different algorithms—a backtracking algorithm and a heuristic algorithm—for solving the vertex k-labeling problem on Circulant graphs and Mongolian Tent graphs. The report must be written in a formal, academic tone suitable for computer science peers and professors, with proper mathematical notation and structured analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a comprehensive technical report that defines the k-labeling problem and introduces the graph classes, so that readers understand the fundamental concepts being studied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include a precise definition of the vertex k-labeling problem
2. WHEN introducing graph classes THEN the report SHALL provide formal mathematical definitions for Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(m,n)$
3. WHEN stating objectives THEN the report SHALL clearly list all four key project objectives (data structures, backtracking algorithm, heuristic algorithm, comparative analysis)
4. WHEN defining scope THEN the report SHALL specify the parameter ranges for graphs to be tested

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an academic reader, I want a thorough background section with literature review, so that I can understand the theoretical foundation and context of the work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing background THEN the report SHALL include concise definitions of graph theory fundamentals
2. WHEN explaining k-labeling THEN the report SHALL elaborate on its definition and significance
3. WHEN describing graph classes THEN the report SHALL provide formal definitions with mathematical notation and simple examples
4. WHEN explaining algorithms THEN the report SHALL describe both backtracking and heuristic strategies conceptually

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical reviewer, I want detailed system design and methodology sections, so that I can understand how the algorithms were implemented and why design choices were made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN describing data structures THEN the report SHALL state the chosen graph representation and justify the choice
2. WHEN presenting algorithms THEN the report SHALL provide clear descriptions, design strategies, and well-commented pseudocode for both backtracking and heuristic approaches
3. WHEN explaining implementation THEN the report SHALL describe traversal methods and output formats
4. WHEN justifying heuristic design THEN the report SHALL explain the rationale and trade-offs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher evaluating algorithmic performance, I want comprehensive results and comparative analysis, so that I can understand the practical differences between the algorithms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presenting experimental setup THEN the report SHALL specify the testing environment and test case parameters
2. WHEN showing results THEN the report SHALL include two properly formatted Markdown tables comparing both algorithms on Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the report SHALL provide theoretical time complexity analysis with mathematical notation
4. WHEN discussing limitations THEN the report SHALL analyze memory complexity and practical hardware constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an academic reader, I want proper conclusions and future work suggestions, so that I can understand the implications and potential research directions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN summarizing findings THEN the report SHALL directly compare the two algorithms and state which is better for specific purposes
2. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the report SHALL provide concrete suggestions for heuristic enhancement
3. WHEN proposing future work THEN the report SHALL suggest new research directions
4. WHEN formatting THEN the report SHALL use proper Markdown structure and LaTeX mathematical notation throughout

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a document consumer, I want proper academic formatting and structure, so that the report meets professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting the document THEN the report SHALL use Markdown for structure including headers, lists, and tables
2. WHEN presenting mathematics THEN the report SHALL use LaTeX notation for all mathematical expressions
3. WHEN organizing content THEN the report SHALL follow the specified 7-section structure exactly
4. WHEN writing THEN the report SHALL maintain formal, academic, and objective tone throughout
