# A Comparative Analysis of k-Labeling Algorithms for Circulant and Mongolian Tent Graphs

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The vertex k-labeling problem is a fundamental challenge in graph theory that involves assigning positive integer labels to the vertices of a graph such that all edge weights (defined as the sum of labels of incident vertices) are distinct. Formally, given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a k-labeling is a function $f: V \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ such that for any two edges $\{u, v\}$ and $\{x, y\}$ in $E$, we have $f(u) + f(v) \neq f(x) + f(y)$ unless $\{u, v\} = \{x, y\}$. The edge irregularity strength of a graph, denoted $es(G)$, is the minimum value of $k$ for which such a labeling exists.

This report investigates the vertex k-labeling problem on two specific families of structured graphs: Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(m,n)$. These graph classes represent important theoretical constructs with applications in network design, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization.

The primary goal of this research is to design, implement, and rigorously compare three distinct algorithmic approaches: a branch and bound (exact) algorithm, a heuristic intelligent algorithm, and a heuristic fast algorithm for solving the k-labeling problem on these specified graph types.

### 1.2. Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

- Implement data structures to represent Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs using efficient adjacency list representations
- Develop a branch and bound algorithm to find optimal k-labelings with guaranteed correctness
- Develop heuristic intelligent and heuristic fast algorithms that provide approximate solutions for larger problem instances
- Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the three algorithms based on performance, solution quality, and computational efficiency
- Analyze the theoretical time complexity and practical hardware limitations of each algorithmic approach

### 1.3. Scope & Limitations

This study focuses on Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ for $n$ up to 12 and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(3,n)$ for $n$ up to 10. The branch and bound algorithm provides optimal solutions but is computationally limited to small graph instances due to its exponential time complexity. The heuristic intelligent and heuristic fast algorithms assume that randomized multi-attempt greedy search can find good solutions quickly, though they do not guarantee optimality or even feasibility in all cases.

The experimental evaluation is conducted on a standard desktop computing environment, and results may vary on different hardware configurations. The study does not address parallel or distributed implementations of the algorithms.

### 1.4. Report Structure

This report is organized into six main sections. Following this introduction, Section 2 details the algorithmic strategies and system design, including algorithm descriptions and pseudocode. Section 3 presents experimental results and comparative analysis. Section 4 concludes with findings and suggestions for future work. Sections 5 and 6 provide references and appendices respectively.

## 2. Algorithmic Strategies & System Design

### 2.1. Algorithmic Approaches

This study employs three distinct algorithmic strategies for solving the vertex k-labeling problem, each representing different trade-offs between solution optimality and computational efficiency.

#### 2.1.1. Branch and Bound

Branch and bound is an intelligent exhaustive search algorithm that combines systematic exploration with sophisticated pruning techniques. It maintains a priority queue of partial solutions ordered by lower bound estimates, allowing it to focus on the most promising branches first. The algorithm calculates lower bounds on the minimum k-value needed to complete each partial labeling, pruning branches that cannot improve upon the current best solution.

For the k-labeling problem, branch and bound builds vertex labelings incrementally while using degree-based bounds, conflict analysis, and remaining vertex constraints to achieve effective pruning. This approach guarantees finding optimal solutions while achieving better practical performance than pure backtracking through intelligent search space reduction.

#### 2.1.2. Heuristics

Heuristic algorithms are strategies designed to find good approximate solutions to computationally hard problems in reasonable time, often by making locally optimal choices at each step. While heuristics do not guarantee optimal solutions, they can provide practical solutions for larger problem instances where exact algorithms become intractable.

The greedy heuristic approach for k-labeling prioritizes vertices by degree and uses randomized multi-attempt search to improve solution quality while maintaining polynomial time complexity. This study implements a dual-mode heuristic system with both intelligent and fast variants to balance solution quality and computational speed.

### 2.2. Data Structure Design

The system employs adjacency list representation for graph storage, where each vertex maintains a list of its neighboring vertices. This design choice is justified by several factors:

- **Memory Efficiency**: For sparse graphs like Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs, adjacency lists require $O(|V| + |E|)$ space compared to $O(|V|^2)$ for adjacency matrices
- **Access Performance**: Neighbor enumeration operates in $O(\deg(v))$ time, which is optimal for the vertex-centric labeling algorithms
- **Dynamic Operations**: The representation supports efficient edge insertion and deletion during graph construction
- **Cache Locality**: Sequential access to neighbor lists provides better memory access patterns than matrix-based approaches

Graphs are represented as Python dictionaries where keys are vertex identifiers and values are lists of adjacent vertices. For Mongolian Tent graphs, vertices are represented as tuples $(row, column)$ with an additional apex vertex. Circulant graphs use integer vertex labels $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$.

### 2.3. Branch and Bound Algorithm Design

The branch and bound algorithm combines systematic search with intelligent pruning 
        using lower bound estimation. It builds vertex labelings incrementally while maintaining a priority 
        queue of partial solutions ordered by their lower bound estimates. For each partial solution, the 
        algorithm calculates a lower bound on the minimum k-value needed to complete the labeling. If this 
        lower bound exceeds the current best known solution, the branch is pruned. The algorithm uses 
        sophisticated bounding techniques including degree-based bounds, conflict analysis, and remaining 
        vertex constraints to achieve effective pruning while guaranteeing optimal solutions.

#### 2.3.1. Algorithm Description

The branch and bound algorithm implements a systematic search with intelligent pruning using lower bound estimation. The core strategy involves:

1. **Priority Queue Management**: Maintain partial solutions ordered by lower bound estimates
2. **Lower Bound Calculation**: Estimate minimum k-value needed to complete each partial labeling
3. **Branch Pruning**: Eliminate branches that cannot improve upon the current best solution
4. **Optimal Solution Tracking**: Update best known solution when complete labelings are found
5. **Intelligent Exploration**: Focus on most promising branches first through priority ordering

#### 2.3.2. Pseudocode Implementation

5. priority_queue.push(initial_state, calculate_lower_bound(initial_state))
6. 
7. WHILE priority_queue is not empty DO
8.     current_state, lower_bound ← priority_queue.pop()
9.     vertex_labels, remaining_vertices, used_weights, current_k ← current_state
10.    
11.    IF lower_bound ≥ best_k THEN

42.                priority_queue.push(new_state, bound)
43. 
44. RETURN (best_k, best_solution)
```

#### 2.3.3. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(k^{|V|} \cdot \log(k^{|V|}))$ where $k$ is the maximum label value and $|V|$ is the number of vertices
- **Space Complexity**: $O(k^{|V|} + |V| + k)$ for priority queue, vertex labels and weight tracking
- **Optimization**: Lower bound estimation provides intelligent pruning with priority queue management

### 2.4. Heuristic Algorithm Design

The heuristic algorithm employs a dual-mode approach with both accurate and fast variants. 
        The accurate mode uses randomized multi-attempt greedy search with intelligent conflict resolution, 
        making multiple attempts to find valid labelings using different vertex orderings and randomized label 
        selection. It prioritizes vertices by degree and failure history, assigns labels using conflict 
        minimization scoring, and incorporates backjumping to recover from local conflicts. The fast mode 
        combines deterministic first-fit greedy assignment with limited randomized passes, trading solution 
        quality for computational speed. Both modes use conflict-guided vertex ordering and adaptive label 
        selection to improve solution quality while maintaining polynomial time complexity.

#### 2.4.1. Algorithm Description

The heuristic algorithm employs a dual-mode approach optimized for different performance requirements:

**Intelligent Mode Features**:
- Randomized multi-attempt search with adaptive vertex ordering
- Conflict minimization scoring for intelligent label selection
- Backjumping mechanism for recovery from local conflicts
- Failure history tracking to guide future attempts

**Fast Mode Features**:
- Deterministic first-fit greedy assignment for baseline solutions
- Limited randomized passes for solution improvement
- Degree-based vertex prioritization for conflict reduction
- Early termination when feasible solutions are found

#### 4.3.3. Scalability Assessment

**Memory Complexity**:

- Bit-array optimization reduces memory footprint by approximately 8× for weight tracking
- No memory-related failures observed within tested parameter ranges

**Computational Limits**:
- Branch and bound becomes impractical for $|V| > 15$ or $k > 20$ due to exponential search space
- Heuristic algorithms scale effectively to larger instances with linear time growth
- Hardware constraints primarily affect branch and bound rather than heuristic performance

#### 4.3.4. Algorithm Comparison Summary

|-----------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Optimality** | Guaranteed | Not guaranteed | Not guaranteed |
| **Speed** | Exponential | Fast | Very fast |
| **Scalability** | Limited | Good | Excellent |
| **Solution Quality** | Optimal | High | Moderate |
| **Reliability** | High (within limits) | High | Moderate |
| **Use Case** | Small instances | Balanced requirements | Time-critical applications |

The experimental results demonstrate clear trade-offs between solution optimality, computational efficiency, and scalability. Branch and bound provides theoretical guarantees at the cost of exponential complexity, while heuristic approaches offer practical solutions for larger problem instances with acceptable solution quality.

- Solution quality depends on randomization parameters and graph structure
- Limited theoretical analysis of approximation guarantees
- Performance variability across different graph topologies

#### 5.1.2. Graph Class Characteristics

**Circulant Graphs**: The regular structure and symmetric properties of Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ generally facilitate better algorithm performance. Both branch and bound and heuristic approaches demonstrate improved success rates and solution quality on these graphs compared to Mongolian Tent graphs.

**Mongolian Tent Graphs**: The mixed structural elements (path-like and star-like components) in $MT(3,n)$ graphs create more challenging optimization landscapes. Heuristic algorithms show greater performance variation, while branch and bound faces earlier computational limits.

#### 5.1.3. Practical Recommendations

Based on the experimental results, we recommend:

- **For small instances** ($|V| \leq 10$): Use branch and bound algorithm for guaranteed optimal solutions
- **For medium instances** ($10 < |V| \leq 20$): Use heuristic intelligent mode for balanced performance
- **For large instances** ($|V| > 20$): Use heuristic fast mode for rapid approximate solutions
- **For time-critical applications**: Always use heuristic fast mode regardless of instance size
- **For research applications**: Use branch and bound when theoretical optimality is required

### 5.3. Final Remarks

This study demonstrates that the choice between exact and heuristic approaches for the k-labeling problem depends critically on the specific requirements of the application. While branch and bound algorithms provide theoretical guarantees, their exponential complexity limits practical applicability. Heuristic algorithms offer a compelling alternative for larger instances, though at the cost of solution optimality guarantees.

The dual-mode heuristic design proves particularly valuable, allowing users to balance solution quality and computational efficiency based on their specific needs. Future work should focus on bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical scalability through improved algorithmic techniques and hybrid approaches.

The insights gained from this comparative analysis contribute to the broader understanding of algorithmic trade-offs in combinatorial optimization and provide a foundation for future research in graph labeling problems.
