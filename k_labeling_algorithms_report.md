# A Comparative Analysis of k-Labeling Algorithms for Circulant and Mongolian Tent Graphs

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The vertex k-labeling problem is a fundamental challenge in graph theory that involves assigning positive integer labels to the vertices of a graph such that all edge weights (defined as the sum of labels of incident vertices) are distinct. Formally, given a graph $G = (V, E)$, a k-labeling is a function $f: V \rightarrow \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$ such that for any two edges $\{u, v\}$ and $\{x, y\}$ in $E$, we have $f(u) + f(v) \neq f(x) + f(y)$ unless $\{u, v\} = \{x, y\}$. The edge irregularity strength of a graph, denoted $es(G)$, is the minimum value of $k$ for which such a labeling exists.

This report investigates the vertex k-labeling problem on two specific families of structured graphs: Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(m,n)$. These graph classes represent important theoretical constructs with applications in network design, coding theory, and combinatorial optimization.

The primary goal of this research is to design, implement, and rigorously compare a backtracking (exact) algorithm against a heuristic (approximate) algorithm for solving the k-labeling problem on these specified graph types.

### 1.2. Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

- Implement data structures to represent Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs using efficient adjacency list representations
- Develop a backtracking algorithm to find optimal k-labelings with guaranteed correctness
- Develop a heuristic-based algorithm that provides fast approximate solutions for larger problem instances
- Conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the two algorithms based on performance, solution quality, and computational efficiency
- Analyze the theoretical time complexity and practical hardware limitations of each algorithmic approach

### 1.3. Scope & Limitations

This study focuses on Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ for $n$ up to 50 and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(3,n)$ for $n$ up to 50. The backtracking algorithm provides optimal solutions but is computationally limited to small graph instances due to its exponential time complexity. The heuristic algorithm assumes that randomized multi-attempt greedy search can find good solutions quickly, though it does not guarantee optimality in all cases.

The experimental evaluation is conducted on a standard desktop computing environment, and results may vary on different hardware configurations. The study does not address parallel or distributed implementations of the algorithms.

### 1.4. Report Structure

This report is organized into six main sections. Following this introduction, Section 2 details the algorithmic strategies and system design, including algorithm descriptions and pseudocode. Section 3 presents experimental results and comparative analysis. Section 4 concludes with findings and suggestions for future work. Sections 5 and 6 provide references and appendices respectively.

## 2. Algorithmic Strategies & System Design

### 2.1. Algorithmic Approaches

This study employs two distinct algorithmic strategies for solving the vertex k-labeling problem, each representing different trade-offs between solution optimality and computational efficiency.

#### 2.1.1. Backtracking

Backtracking is an exhaustive search algorithm that builds solutions incrementally and abandons partial solutions (backtracks) as soon as it determines they cannot lead to a valid complete solution. The algorithm maintains the invariant that all partial assignments satisfy the problem constraints, using constraint propagation to prune the search space early.

For the k-labeling problem, backtracking assigns labels to vertices one by one, checking edge weight uniqueness at each step and backtracking when conflicts arise. This approach guarantees finding optimal solutions when they exist but suffers from exponential time complexity.

#### 2.1.2. Heuristics

Heuristic algorithms are strategies designed to find good approximate solutions to computationally hard problems in reasonable time, often by making locally optimal choices at each step. While heuristics do not guarantee optimal solutions, they can provide practical solutions for larger problem instances where exact algorithms become intractable.

The greedy heuristic approach for k-labeling prioritizes vertices by degree and uses randomized multi-attempt search to improve solution quality while maintaining polynomial time complexity. This study implements a dual-mode heuristic system with both accurate and fast variants to balance solution quality and computational speed.

### 2.2. Data Structure Design

The system employs adjacency list representation for graph storage, where each vertex maintains a list of its neighboring vertices. This design choice is justified by several factors:

- **Memory Efficiency**: For sparse graphs like Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs, adjacency lists require $O(|V| + |E|)$ space compared to $O(|V|^2)$ for adjacency matrices
- **Access Performance**: Neighbor enumeration operates in $O(\deg(v))$ time, which is optimal for the vertex-centric labeling algorithms
- **Dynamic Operations**: The representation supports efficient edge insertion and deletion during graph construction
- **Cache Locality**: Sequential access to neighbor lists provides better memory access patterns than matrix-based approaches

Graphs are represented as Python dictionaries where keys are vertex identifiers and values are lists of adjacent vertices. For Mongolian Tent graphs, vertices are represented as tuples $(row, column)$ with an additional apex vertex. Circulant graphs use integer vertex labels $\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$.

### 2.3. Backtracking Algorithm Design

The backtracking algorithm employs a systematic exhaustive search approach that builds 
        vertex labelings incrementally. It processes vertices in a predetermined order, trying each possible 
        label value from 1 to k for the current vertex. For each label assignment, it checks whether the 
        resulting edge weights conflict with previously assigned weights. If no conflicts arise, the algorithm 
        recursively proceeds to the next vertex. When conflicts are detected or no valid label exists for 
        the current vertex, the algorithm backtracks by undoing the current assignment and trying the next 
        possible label.

#### 2.3.1. Algorithm Description

The backtracking algorithm implements a systematic exhaustive search with constraint propagation and early pruning. The core strategy involves:

1. **Vertex Ordering**: Process vertices in a predetermined order to maintain consistency
2. **Label Assignment**: Try each possible label value from 1 to k for the current vertex
3. **Constraint Checking**: Verify that new edge weights do not conflict with existing assignments
4. **Recursive Exploration**: Proceed to the next vertex when constraints are satisfied
5. **Backtracking**: Undo assignments and try alternative labels when conflicts arise

#### 2.3.2. Pseudocode Implementation

```
ALGORITHM: Backtracking k-Labeling
INPUT: adjacency_list, max_k_value, vertex_labels, unlabeled_vertices, used_weights
OUTPUT: Complete valid labeling or None

1. IF unlabeled_vertices is empty THEN
2.     IF is_labeling_valid(vertex_labels) THEN
3.         RETURN vertex_labels
4.     ELSE
5.         RETURN None
6. 
7. vertex_to_label ← first vertex in unlabeled_vertices
8. remaining_vertices ← unlabeled_vertices without first vertex
9. 
10. FOR label = 1 to max_k_value DO
11.     vertex_labels[vertex_to_label] ← label
12.     new_weights ← empty list
13.     conflict ← False
14.     
15.     FOR each neighbor of vertex_to_label DO
16.         IF neighbor is already labeled THEN
17.             weight ← label + vertex_labels[neighbor]
18.             IF used_weights[weight] is True THEN
19.                 conflict ← True
20.                 BREAK
21.             new_weights.append(weight)
22.     
23.     IF NOT conflict THEN
24.         FOR each weight in new_weights DO
25.             used_weights[weight] ← True
26.         
27.         result ← BACKTRACK(adjacency_list, max_k_value, vertex_labels, 
28.                           remaining_vertices, used_weights)
29.         IF result is not None THEN
30.             RETURN result
31.         
32.         FOR each weight in new_weights DO
33.             used_weights[weight] ← False
34. 
35. DELETE vertex_labels[vertex_to_label]
36. RETURN None
```

#### 2.3.3. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(k^{|V|})$ where $k$ is the maximum label value and $|V|$ is the number of vertices
- **Space Complexity**: $O(|V| + k)$ for vertex labels and weight tracking
- **Optimization**: Bit-array implementation provides $O(1)$ conflict detection with reduced memory overhead

### 2.4. Heuristic Algorithm Design

The heuristic algorithm employs a dual-mode approach with both accurate and fast variants. 
        The accurate mode uses randomized multi-attempt greedy search with intelligent conflict resolution, 
        making multiple attempts to find valid labelings using different vertex orderings and randomized label 
        selection. It prioritizes vertices by degree and failure history, assigns labels using conflict 
        minimization scoring, and incorporates backjumping to recover from local conflicts. The fast mode 
        combines deterministic first-fit greedy assignment with limited randomized passes, trading solution 
        quality for computational speed. Both modes use conflict-guided vertex ordering and adaptive label 
        selection to improve solution quality while maintaining polynomial time complexity.

#### 2.4.1. Algorithm Description

The heuristic algorithm employs a dual-mode approach optimized for different performance requirements:

**Accurate Mode Features**:
- Randomized multi-attempt search with adaptive vertex ordering
- Conflict minimization scoring for intelligent label selection
- Backjumping mechanism for recovery from local conflicts
- Failure history tracking to guide future attempts

**Fast Mode Features**:
- Deterministic first-fit greedy assignment for baseline solutions
- Limited randomized passes for solution improvement
- Degree-based vertex prioritization for conflict reduction
- Early termination when feasible solutions are found

## 5. Conclusions & Future Work

### 5.1. Summary of Findings

This comparative study of k-labeling algorithms for Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs reveals significant insights into the trade-offs between algorithmic approaches for combinatorial optimization problems.

#### 5.1.2. Graph Class Characteristics

**Circulant Graphs**: The regular structure and symmetric properties of Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ generally facilitate better algorithm performance. Both backtracking and heuristic approaches demonstrate improved success rates and solution quality on these graphs compared to Mongolian Tent graphs.

**Mongolian Tent Graphs**: The mixed structural elements (path-like and star-like components) in $MT(3,n)$ graphs create more challenging optimization landscapes. Heuristic algorithms show greater performance variation, while backtracking faces earlier computational limits.

#### 5.1.3. Practical Recommendations

Based on the experimental results, we recommend:

- **For small instances** ($|V| \leq 10$): Use backtracking algorithm for guaranteed optimal solutions
- **For medium instances** ($10 < |V| \leq 20$): Use heuristic accurate mode for balanced performance
- **For large instances** ($|V| > 20$): Use heuristic intelligent mode for fast approximate solutions
- **For time-critical applications**: Always use heuristic intelligent mode regardless of instance size

### 5.3. Final Remarks

This study demonstrates that the choice between exact and heuristic approaches for the k-labeling problem depends critically on the specific requirements of the application. While backtracking algorithms provide theoretical guarantees, their exponential complexity limits practical applicability. Heuristic algorithms offer a compelling alternative for larger instances, though at the cost of solution optimality guarantees.

The dual-mode heuristic design proves particularly valuable, allowing users to balance solution quality and computational efficiency based on their specific needs. Future work should focus on bridging the gap between theoretical optimality and practical scalability through improved algorithmic techniques and hybrid approaches.

The insights gained from this comparative analysis contribute to the broader understanding of algorithmic trade-offs in combinatorial optimization and provide a foundation for future research in graph labeling problems.
