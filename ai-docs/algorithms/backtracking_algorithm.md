# Exact Backtracking Algorithm for Optimal k-Labeling

*Last updated: 2025-07-09*

## 1. Motivation

The **exact backtracking search** guarantees that the smallest possible label
range \(k\) is found for the Mongolian Tent graph \(\text{MT}_{3,n}\).  Unlike the
heuristic solver, it *always* returns the true optimum, but at the price of
exponential worst-case runtime.  Consequently it is practical only for small
values of \(n\) (\(n \lesssim 10\) on a typical laptop).

The implementation lives in `find_optimal_k_labeling()` and the recursive helper
`_backtrack_k_labeling()`.

---

## 2. High-Level Procedure

1. **Lower-bound start** – Compute the theoretical lower bound
   `LB(n) = calculate_lower_bound(n)`.
2. **Iterate over k** – For each candidate \(k = \text{LB}, \text{LB} + 1, …\):
   1. Run the *depth-first* backtracking search described in Section&nbsp;3.
   2. If the search returns a valid full labeling → **return (k, labeling)**.
3. The first success is necessarily *optimal* because \(k\) is increased
   monotonically.

## 3. Recursive Backtracking Core

```python
result = _backtrack_k_labeling(adjacency_list, k, {}, ordered_vertices)
```

### 3.1 Vertex Ordering

Vertices are processed **in descending degree order** to maximise early pruning.
Formally:

```python
ordered_vertices = sorted(V, key=lambda v: deg(v), reverse=True)
```

### 3.2 Recursive Step

For the current vertex `v` (first of the remaining list):

1. **Try each label** `ℓ ∈ {1 … k}`
2. Tentatively assign `label[v] = ℓ`.
3. Call `is_labeling_valid()` **only on edges incident to `v`** – \(O(\deg v)\)
   instead of \(O(E)\).
4. If partial validation passes, recurse on the *remaining* vertices.
5. If no label leads to a solution, *backtrack* (undo assignment) and return
   `None`.

### 3.3 Base Case

When the list of *unlabeled_vertices* is empty, a complete valid labeling has
been found → return it up the call stack.

## 4. Complexity Analysis

Let \(V = |V|\) and \(E = |E|\).  In the worst case the algorithm tries
\(k^{|V|}\) assignments; with \(k ≈ LB(n) ≈ 3n\) that is **exponential in \(n\)**.

Pruning strategies (degree ordering + partial validation) substantially reduce
the search space in practice, but the asymptotic remains exponential.

| Graph size | Typical runtime* | Notes |
|------------|------------------|-------|
| `n ≤ 6` | < 1 s | Exhaustive search is trivial |
| `n = 8` | 1–5 s | Still comfortable |
| `n = 10` | 30 s – 2 min | Steep growth |
| `n ≥ 12` | minutes → hours | Often infeasible |

## 5. Correctness Proof Sketch

1. The algorithm enumerates *every* label combination in \(\{1 … k\}^{|V|}\)
   unless pruned by failing the uniqueness constraint.
2. Pruning never removes a labeling that could be extended to a valid full
   solution (because validation checks only incident edges).
3. Therefore, if a valid labeling exists for the current \(k\), the recursive
   search will eventually find it.
4. The outer loop increases \(k\) monotonically, so the *first* found labeling
   uses the **minimum possible k**.

## 6. Implementation Highlights

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|---------------|
| `_get_vertex_sort_key()` | Stable ordering for tuple / string vertex IDs |
| `is_labeling_valid()` | Omit duplicate edge-weight check (partial vs. full) |
| `_backtrack_k_labeling()` | Depth-first search with pruning |
| `find_optimal_k_labeling()` | Driver: iterate over k and report result |

All functions reside in `src/labeling_solver.py`.

---

## 7. Example (n = 5)

```text
MT₍₃,₅₎ has 17 vertices and 45 edges.
calculate_lower_bound(5) = 8

k = 8  → backtracking fails
k = 9  → valid labeling found after 1 540 recursive calls
```

(The exact call count depends on vertex ordering.)

## 8. Strengths & Limitations

### Strengths
* **Optimal** – returns the provably minimum \(k\).
* **Deterministic** (no RNG) – fully reproducible results.
* **Simple** – clear recursion, easy to reason about.

### Limitations
* **Exponential time** → unusable for medium/large \(n\).
* CPU-bound; difficult to parallelise because of fine-grained recursion.

---

## 9. Future Work

1. **Iterative deepening** – Try depth-bounded DFS to share suffixes between
   successive \(k\) values.
2. **Bound consistency** – Use arc consistency or DSATUR-style heuristics to
   prune labels earlier.
3. **Parallel branches** – Explore top-level vertex label splits concurrently
   with multiprocessing or C-extensions.
