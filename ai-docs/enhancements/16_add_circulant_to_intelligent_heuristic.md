# Enhancement: Integrate Circulant Graphs with Intelligent Heuristic Algorithm

## 1. Introduction

The current intelligent heuristic algorithm for vertex k-labeling primarily focuses on general graph structures. This enhancement aims to extend its capabilities to specifically handle circulant graphs, leveraging their unique properties to potentially improve performance and accuracy for this specific graph family.

## 2. Problem Statement

While the intelligent heuristic algorithm provides a robust approach for various graphs, it does not currently optimize its strategy for the inherent symmetries and structured nature of circulant graphs. This can lead to suboptimal performance or labeling quality compared to what might be achievable by incorporating circulant-specific insights.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves modifying or extending the intelligent heuristic algorithm to recognize and utilize the structural properties of circulant graphs. This could include:

*   [x] **Pre-processing:** Identifying if the input graph is a circulant graph and, if so, applying specific pre-processing steps.
*   [x] **Labeling Strategy Adaptation:** Adjusting the heuristic's vertex selection, label assignment, or conflict resolution strategies to exploit the cyclic and symmetric nature of circulant graphs. This might involve prioritizing vertices based on their position in the circulant structure or using patterns derived from circulant properties.
*   [x] **Integration with Circulant-Specific Components:** Potentially integrating with existing or new components designed for circulant graph analysis (e.g., theoretical lower bound calculations, specialized graph generation).

## 4. Benefits

*   **Improved Performance:** Faster labeling times for circulant graphs due to specialized handling.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** Potentially finding better k-labelings (lower k-values) by leveraging circulant properties.
*   **Specialized Application:** Broadens the applicability and efficiency of the intelligent heuristic for a significant class of graphs.

## 5. Technical Details

*   [ ] **Modification of `labeling_solver.py`:** The intelligent heuristic logic within `labeling_solver.py` will need to be updated to include checks for circulant graph properties and conditional logic for applying circulant-specific strategies.
*   [ ] **Integration with `graph_properties.py`:** Utilize functions from `graph_properties.py` (or add new ones) to identify and extract relevant circulant graph parameters (e.g., `n`, `s_set`).
*   [ ] **Potential New Modules:** Depending on the complexity, new helper functions or modules might be introduced to encapsulate circulant-specific heuristic logic.

## 6. Testing Considerations

*   [x] **Unit Tests:** Develop new unit tests specifically for circulant graphs to verify the correctness and performance of the enhanced intelligent heuristic.
*   [x] **Regression Tests:** Ensure that the changes do not negatively impact the performance or accuracy of the intelligent heuristic on general graphs.
*   [x] **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare the performance of the enhanced algorithm on circulant graphs against the previous version and other relevant solvers.
