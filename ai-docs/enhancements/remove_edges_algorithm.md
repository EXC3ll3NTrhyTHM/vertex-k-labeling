# Algorithm: Create a Graph by Removing Edges from a Complete Graph

This algorithm details a two-step process: first, define a complete circulant graph (**Kₙ**), and second, remove the edges corresponding to the closest neighbors until each vertex's degree has been reduced by 5.

## Step 1: Define the Complete Graph (**Kₙ**)

A complete graph connects every vertex to every other vertex. In a circulant graph context, this means we use all possible step sizes (generators).

- **Input**: A positive integer *n* (the number of vertices).

### Vertices:
Define the vertices 

\[
V = \{0,1,2,...,n-1\}
\]

### Complete Edge Set:
Create the set of all possible edges, *E_complete*. This is done by connecting every vertex *i* to every other vertex *j*. Equivalently, using generators:

For each vertex *i* from 0 to n-1:

- For each possible step size *s* from 1 to floor(n/2):
  - Add an edge between vertex *i* and vertex *(i + s) mod n*.

At the end of this step, you have a complete graph where every vertex has a degree of *n-1*.

## Step 2: Identify and Remove Edges of Closest Neighbors

The goal is to reduce the degree of each vertex by 5. We do this by removing the edges associated with the smallest generators first.

- **Removing edges from generator s=1**: Removes the connection to the two nearest neighbors for each vertex, reducing its degree by 2.

- **Removing edges from generator s=2**: Removes the connection to the next two nearest neighbors, reducing its degree by another 2.

After removing the edges from generators s=1 and s=2, the degree of each vertex has been reduced by 4. We still need to reduce the degree by 1 more. This is where the algorithm must branch.

### Case A: *n* is an Even Number

If *n* is even, there is a unique generator, *s = n/2*, that connects each vertex to its direct opposite. This is the only generator that contributes just 1 to the degree of each vertex.

- **Identify Generators to Remove**: 

\[
S_{remove} = \{1,2,n/2\}
\]

- **Remove the Edges**: For each vertex *i* from 0 to n-1:

  - Remove the edge connecting *i* to *(i + 1) mod n*.
  - Remove the edge connecting *i* to *(i + 2) mod n*.
  - Remove the edge connecting *i* to *(i + n/2) mod n*.

**Final Result**: The resulting graph will have a degree of *(n-1) - 5 = n-6*. The edges that remain are those generated by the set

\[
S_{final} = \{3,4,...,(n/2-1)\}
\]

---

### Case B: *n* is an Odd Number

If *n* is odd, there is no generator that connects a vertex to a single opposite vertex. Every generator *s* (where *s < n/2*) connects a vertex to two other vertices, contributing 2 to the degree.

> **Conclusion**: It is impossible to reduce the degree of every vertex by an odd number (like 5) while maintaining a symmetric circulant structure. You can only reduce the degree in increments of 2.

Therefore, this algorithm is only valid for **even values of n**.

## Summary

To reduce the degree of a complete graph **Kₙ** by 5 in a circulant manner:

1. The number of vertices, *n*, must be even.
2. Start with the complete graph where all vertices are connected.
3. Remove all edges corresponding to the generators *s=1*, *s=2*, and *s=n/2*.

The final graph is a **(n-6)-regular circulant graph**.
