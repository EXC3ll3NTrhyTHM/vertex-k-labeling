# Task: Complete Intelligent Heuristic Accuracy Enhancement

## Overview
This task focuses on the implementation of the accuracy enhancements for the "intelligent" heuristic algorithm as detailed in `ai-docs/enhancements/enhancement_intelligent_heuristic_accuracy.md`. The goal is to refine the core strategies of vertex ordering, label selection, and local search within `src/labeling_solver.py` to achieve superior accuracy (lower `k` values) and improved performance for k-labeling.

## Core Implementation Areas
1.  **Refined Vertex Ordering (Advanced Degree-Biased Randomization):** Implement a dynamic scoring mechanism for unlabeled vertices that considers degree, connectivity to labeled neighbors, and potential conflicts.
2.  **Adaptive Conflict-Directed Label Selection (Dynamic Conflict Thresholds):** Enhance the label selection logic to dynamically adjust acceptable conflict thresholds based on the labeling process state.
3.  **Multi-Strategy Local Search Repair Mechanism:** Refactor the local search to support multiple repair heuristics and a switching mechanism to escape local minima.

## Expected Outcome
- The `intelligent` mode in `src/labeling_solver.py` will consistently find lower `k` values and/or complete the labeling process faster for a wider range of graph sizes and complexities.
- All new logic will be thoroughly tested with updated and new test cases in `tests/test_heuristic_solver.py`.

# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Advanced Vertex Ordering & Adaptive Label Selection
- **Task 1.1: Refine Dynamic Scoring for Vertex Selection**
    - Modify the vertex selection logic in `src/labeling_solver.py` to incorporate a dynamic scoring mechanism. This score should consider:
        - Vertex degree.
        - Number of already-labeled neighbors.
        - Potential conflicts based on current partial labeling.
    - Prioritize vertices with higher scores.
- **Task 1.2: Implement Adaptive Conflict Thresholds for Label Selection**
    - Update the label selection function in `src/labeling_solver.py` to include adaptive conflict thresholds.
    - Allow for dynamic adjustment of acceptable conflict levels based on the stage of the labeling process (e.g., stricter early on, more lenient later).
- **Task 1.3: Integrate Refined Strategies into Greedy Pass**
    - Integrate the updated vertex ordering and adaptive label selection into the main greedy pass for the `intelligent` mode in `src/labeling_solver.py`.

## Phase 2: Multi-Strategy Local Search & Comprehensive Testing
- **Task 2.1: Develop Multi-Strategy Local Search Repair Mechanism**
    - Refactor the local search repair mechanism in `src/labeling_solver.py` to support multiple repair strategies (e.g., iterative minimum conflict re-labeling, tabu search, simulated annealing-like perturbations).
    - Implement a switching mechanism to trigger alternative strategies if the primary one gets stuck.
- **Task 2.2: Update and Add Comprehensive Tests**
    - Update existing unit and integration tests in `tests/test_heuristic_solver.py` to cover the enhanced `intelligent` mode.
    - Add new test cases to specifically validate the accuracy and performance improvements, including edge cases and benchmarks against previous versions and other heuristics.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  Phase 1 tasks (vertex ordering and adaptive label selection) are foundational and must be completed before Phase 2, as they directly impact the initial greedy labeling.
2.  The multi-strategy local search (Task 2.1) depends on the outcome of the greedy pass from Phase 1.
3.  Comprehensive testing (Task 2.2) should be an ongoing process but can only be finalized once all implementation from both phases is complete and integrated.

# Risks and Mitigations (from PRD)
- **Risk 1: Over-optimization leading to diminishing returns:** Implement changes incrementally and rigorously benchmark each iteration. Define clear performance and accuracy targets.
- **Risk 2: Increased computational time for advanced heuristics:** Profile all new components extensively. Prioritize strategies that offer the best accuracy-to-performance ratio. Explore approximations or pre-computation.
- **Risk 3: Difficulty in tuning multiple heuristic parameters:** Design parameters to be robust and self-adjusting where possible. Provide clear documentation and default values. Consider automated parameter tuning.
