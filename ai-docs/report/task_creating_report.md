## A Comparative Analysis of k-Labeling Algorithms for Circulant and Mongolian Tent Graphs

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Problem Statement:

Start by defining the vertex k-labeling problem. You will be provided with the specific definition. [Insert your precise k-labeling definition here].

Introduce the two graph classes under investigation: Circulant graphs and Mongolian Tent graphs.

Clearly state the primary goal: to design, implement, and rigorously compare a backtracking (exact) algorithm against a heuristic (approximate) algorithm for this problem on the specified graph types.

### 1.2. Project Objectives:

List the following as the key objectives of the project:

- Implement data structures to represent Circulant and Mongolian Tent graphs.
- Develop a backtracking algorithm to find a valid k-labeling.
- Develop a heuristic-based algorithm for the same purpose.
- Conduct a comparative analysis of the two algorithms based on performance, solution quality, and computational efficiency.
- Analyze the theoretical time complexity and practical hardware limitations of each algorithm.

### 1.3. Scope & Limitations:

Define the scope by specifying the parameters of the graphs that will be tested. [Example: "Circulant graphs $C_n(S)$ for $n$ up to 50 and Mongolian Tent graphs $MT(m,n)$ for $m, n$ up to 20 will be considered."].

State any assumptions made by the heuristic algorithm. [Example: "The heuristic algorithm assumes... and does not guarantee optimality."].

### 1.4. Report Structure:

Briefly summarize the layout of the report you are about to write.

## 2. Background & Literature Review

### 2.1. Graph Theory Fundamentals:

Provide concise definitions of a graph, vertices ($V$), and edges ($E$).

Briefly explain graph representations, focusing on the one used in the project.

### 2.2. Vertex k-Labeling:

Elaborate on the definition of vertex k-labeling provided in the introduction. Discuss its significance or applications if known.

### 2.3. Graph Classes:

#### 2.3.1. Circulant Graphs:

Provide a formal definition, including mathematical notation (e.g., $C_n(S)$). Show a small, simple example.

#### 2.3.2. Mongolian Tent Graphs:

Provide a formal definition (e.g., $MT(m,n)$). Show a small, simple example.

### 2.4. Algorithmic Strategies:

#### 2.4.1. Backtracking:

Explain the concept of backtracking as an exhaustive search algorithm that builds a solution incrementally and abandons a path as soon as it determines it cannot lead to a valid solution.

#### 2.4.2. Heuristics:

Explain that heuristics are strategies used to find good, approximate solutions to computationally hard problems in a reasonable amount of time, often by making "best-guess" decisions at each step.

## 3. System Design & Methodology

### 3.1. Data Structure for Graph Representation:

State the chosen data structure. [Example: "An Adjacency List was chosen..."].

Justify this choice. [Example: "...due to its memory efficiency for sparse graphs, which is characteristic of the tested graph types."].

### 3.2. Algorithm 1: Backtracking Approach:

Design Strategy: Explain that backtracking was chosen to provide a baseline of correct, optimal solutions against which the heuristic can be compared.

Algorithm Description: Describe the logic in plain English. [Provide the core logic of your backtracking algorithm here].

Pseudocode: Generate clear and well-commented pseudocode for the backtracking algorithm.

### 3.3. Algorithm 2: Heuristic Approach:

Design Strategy: Describe the heuristic. [Example: "A greedy algorithm was designed that assigns labels to vertices in descending order of their degree..."].

Justification: Explain the rationale. [Example: "...The rationale is that prioritizing high-degree vertices will resolve the most constrained parts of the graph first."]. Mention the trade-off (speed for optimality).

Algorithm Description: Describe the step-by-step logic of the heuristic. [Provide the core logic of your heuristic algorithm here].

Pseudocode: Generate clear and well-commented pseudocode for the heuristic algorithm.

### 3.4. Traversal and Implementation Details:

Explain if and how traversal methods like DFS or BFS are used in your algorithms.

Describe the output format for the final vertex labels and edge weights. [Example: "The results are stored in a dictionary where keys are vertex IDs and values are their assigned labels."].

## 4. Results & Comparative Analysis

### 4.1. Experimental Setup:

Specify the environment. [Example: "Tests were run on a machine with an Intel Core i7 CPU and 16GB of RAM, using Python 3.9."].

Detail the test cases used. [Provide the ranges of n, m, and k you tested for both graph types].

### 4.2. Comparative Results:

Correctness & Quality: For a few key examples, show the output of both algorithms. Discuss how close the heuristic's solution is to the backtracking's optimal solution.

Tabulated Outcomes: Generate two Markdown tables with the following columns: Graph Parameters, Backtracking Result (or time to fail), Heuristic Result, Execution Time (Backtracking), Execution Time (Heuristic).

One table for Circulant Graphs.

One table for Mongolian Tent Graphs.

### 4.3. Performance Analysis:

#### 4.3.1. Time Complexity Analysis:

Provide the theoretical time complexity for the Backtracking algorithm (e.g., $O(k^V)$) and explain its derivation.

Provide the theoretical time complexity for the Heuristic algorithm (e.g., $O(V+E)$) and explain its derivation.

#### 4.3.2. Hardware Resource Limits:

Analyze the memory complexity of each algorithm.

Discuss the practical limitations. Conclude that backtracking is time-limited, while the heuristic is more scalable and eventually memory-limited for very large graphs.

## 5. Conclusion

### 5.1. Summary of Findings:

Summarize the results from your tables. Directly compare the two algorithms. State which is better for which purpose (e.g., "Backtracking guarantees correctness but is only feasible for small graphs, whereas the heuristic provides near-instant results for much larger graphs at the cost of potential sub-optimality.").

### 5.2. Future Work:

Suggest potential improvements. [Example: "The heuristic could be improved by incorporating a local search component..."].

Suggest new research directions. [Example: "Future work could involve applying these algorithms to other families of structured graphs."].
